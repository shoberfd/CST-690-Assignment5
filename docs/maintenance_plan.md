# Maintenance and Scaling Plan for Enterprise Inventory Bot

## 1. Patch and Release Processes
We will use **Git flow** for our branching strategy.
- **Hotfixes:** Will be applied to the `main` branch and tagged with a new version.
- **Features:** Will be applied to the `main` branch and tagged with a new version.
- **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** will automate testing, building, and deployment upon new releases.

## 2. Dependency Management
- **Requirements:** We will use `pip-tools` to manage dependencies. `requirements.txt` will be used for reproducible builds.

## 3. Scaling Strategy
- **Horizontal Scaling:** The bot is designed to be stateless, allowing it to be deployed as multiple instances via Docker. Docker Compose can be scaled up to run multiple instances of the bot.
- **5x/10x Workload:** Deploy multiple bot containers, with each instance handling a portion of the workload.

## 4. Recovery Plans
- **Retries:** Exponential backoff will be implemented for transient errors.
- **Failover Logic:** If a critical dependency fails, the bot will gracefully degrade or failover to a secondary service if available.

## 5. Code Examples
```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    try:
        print("Starting script...")
        setup_logging()
        print("Logging is set up.")
        start_http_server(9100)
        print("Prometheus metrics server started on port 9100.")
        print("Bot is now processing inventory batches...")
        
        # Error checking, ensures the bot continuously makes batches
        while True:
            process_inventory_batch()
            time.sleep(random.uniform(1, 3))
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
```
```python
# --- Prometheus Metrics Instrumentation ---
REQUEST_LATENCY = Summary('inventory_batch_duration_seconds', 'Inventory batch duration in seconds')
TRANSACTIONS_PROCESSED = Counter('inventory_transactions_total', 'Total number of inventory items processed', ['outcome'])
```
```python
# --- Core Bot Logic with Error Recovery ---
def process_inventory_item(item):
    if random.random() < 0.2:
        # A simulated API failure using the imported requests library
        raise requests.exceptions.RequestException("Simulated API failure")
    return {"status": "success", "item_id": item}
```
