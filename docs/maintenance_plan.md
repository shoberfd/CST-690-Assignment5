# Maintenance and Scaling Plan for Enterprise Inventory Bot

## 1. Patch and Release Processes
We will use **Git flow** for our branching strategy.
- **Hotfixes:** Will be applied to the `main` branch and tagged with a new version.
- **Features:** Will be developed on feature branches and merged into `develop` after code review.
- **CI/CD:** **GitHub Actions** will automate testing, building, and deployment upon new releases.

## 2. Dependency Management
- **Requirements:** We will use `pip-tools` to manage dependencies. `requirements.in` will contain direct dependencies, and `requirements.txt` will be generated for reproducible builds.
- **Vulnerability Scanning:** **Dependabot** will be enabled to automatically check for and alert on security vulnerabilities.

## 3. Scaling Strategy
- **Horizontal Scaling:** The bot is designed to be stateless, allowing it to be deployed as multiple instances via Docker. Docker Compose can be scaled up to run multiple instances of the bot.
- **5x/10x Workload:** Deploy multiple bot containers, with each instance handling a portion of the workload.
- **100x Workload:** Implement a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, SQS) to decouple the workload, allowing workers to process tasks asynchronously.

## 4. Recovery Plans
- **Retries:** Exponential backoff will be implemented for transient errors.
- **Failover Logic:** If a critical dependency fails, the bot will gracefully degrade or failover to a secondary service if available.
- **Dead-letter Queues:** Failed messages that cannot be processed after a maximum number of retries will be moved to a dead-letter queue for manual inspection.

## 5. Code Examples
[Python code examples for retries, failover, etc.]
