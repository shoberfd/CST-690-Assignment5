# Monitoring Strategy for Enterprise Inventory Bot

## 1. Objective
To establish a robust monitoring framework for the enterprise-wide rollout of the inventory bot. This plan covers telemetry, storage, visualization, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## 2. Telemetry and Data Emittance
The bot will emit structured **JSON logs** for detailed event tracking and **Prometheus metrics** for real-time performance data.
- **Logs:** Events such as `batch_start`, `item_processed`, `api_error`, and `retry_success` will be logged.
- **Metrics:** We will track key metrics like transaction latency, error rates, and CPU/memory usage.

## 3. Data Storage
- **JSON Logs:** Will be written to a rotating file system, e.g., `/logs/inventory.log`, with a retention policy of 7 days.
- **Prometheus Metrics:** The bot will expose a `/metrics` endpoint, which will be scraped by a Prometheus server.

## 4. Visualization and Alerting
- **Visualization:** A dashboard will display key metrics and log data to provide a real-time overview of the bot's health.
- **Alerting:** Alerts will be configured to trigger on predefined thresholds. For example, an alert will be sent if the **error rate** exceeds 5% over a 5-minute window or if the **average transaction latency** surpasses a 2-second threshold.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Transaction Success Rate:** Percentage of successfully processed inventory transactions.
- **Average Transaction Latency:** The mean time taken for a single transaction to complete.
- **Error Rate:** The frequency of critical errors (e.g., API failures, database timeouts).
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU and memory usage of the bot instances.
