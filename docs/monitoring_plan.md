# Monitoring Strategy for Enterprise Inventory Bot

## 1. Objective
To establish a robust monitoring framework for the enterprise-wide rollout of the inventory bot. This plan covers telemetry, storage, visualization, and key performance indicators (KPIs).

## 2. Telemetry and Data Emittance
The bot will emit structured **JSON logs** for detailed event tracking and **Prometheus metrics** for real-time performance data.
- **Logs:** Events such as `batch_start`, `item_processed`, `api_error`, and `retry_success` will be logged to a rotating file system.
- **Metrics:** We track key metrics like transaction latency, error rates, and resource utilization.

## 3. Data Storage and Orchestration
- **Data Flow:** The Python bot runs on the host machine, exposing a metrics endpoint on port 9100. A **Prometheus container**, managed by Docker Compose, scrapes this endpoint for data.
- **Log Storage:** JSON logs will be written to a local file, e.g., `/logs/inventory.log`, with a retention policy of 7 days.
- **Metrics Storage:** Prometheus pulls the metrics from the bot and stores them in its time-series database.

## 4. Visualization and Alerting
- **Visualization:** A **Grafana container**, also managed by Docker Compose, connects to Prometheus to display real-time dashboards of key metrics.

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Transaction Success Rate:** Percentage of successfully processed inventory transactions.
- **Average Transaction Latency:** The mean time taken for a single transaction to complete.
- **Error Rate:** The frequency of critical errors (e.g., API failures, timeouts).
- **Resource Utilization:** CPU and memory usage of the bot instances.
