# ROI Evaluation for Enterprise Inventory Bot

## 1. Cost-Benefit Model
This model provides a cost-benefit analysis for scaling the inventory bot, based on synthetic projections and operational metrics.

## 2. Synthetic Projections
- **Transactions Processed:** We project a linear increase in transactions from a base of 10,000 per day to 50,000, 100,000, and 1,000,000 as we scale out to 5x, 10x, and 100x workloads.
- **Synthetic Data:** The script `generate_fake_logs.py` in `/scripts/` was used to simulate these transaction volumes and their associated metrics.

## 3. Cost Per Transaction
- **Calculation:** Cost per transaction is estimated by combining CPU time, I/O operations, retries, and error rates.
- **Baseline:** At a single instance, the cost is estimated at $0.005 per transaction.
- **Scale-out:** With horizontal scaling, the cost per transaction decreases due to optimized resource utilization.

## 4. Labor Minutes Saved
- **Baseline:** A manual inventory check takes an average of 5 minutes per workflow.
- **Automation:** The bot reduces this to under 1 minute.
- **Projection:** Scaling the bot to 100x workload could save thousands of labor hours per month.

## 5. Downtime Avoided & Qualitative Benefits
- **Downtime:** The maintenance plan's recovery logic minimizes downtime, with each hour of downtime costing an estimated $5,000 in lost productivity.
- **Benefits:** Improved accuracy, reduced human error, and enhanced customer experience due to real-time inventory updates.
